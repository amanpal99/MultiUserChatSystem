# MultiUserChatSystem
It is a simple multi user chatting system made in Java using Socket Programming. Users connect to same network can chat with each other. It is like a intranet chatting app for desktop

To make it work you need to create a simple database to save chat, although it uses sqllite but when user is offline it save 
message on database and then send it to particular user.
